	<h1>Mass Incarceration</h1>
	<div class = "candidate" id = "krasner">
		<h3>Krasner (D)</h3>
		<p>If elected, Krasner plans to review convictions as evidence becomes available and release the wrongfully convicted. He thinks we can help lessen mass incarceration by treating addiction as a medical problem, rather than a crime by allowing those arrested for drug possession to pursue treatment instead of incarceration. He also wants to bring police and the communities they serve together.</p>
	</div>
	<div class = "candidate" id = "grossman">
		<h3>Grossman (R)</h3>
		<p>Grossman supports re-entry programs that allow people being released from incarceration to return to family, community and work. She wants those who have successfully completed re-entry programs to help prevent incarceration by reaching out to juveniles.</p>
