		<h3>Krasner (D)</h3>
		<p>If elected, Krasner plans to review convictions as evidence becomes available and release the wrongfully convicted.

		<h3>Grossman (R)</h3>
		<p>Grossman supports re-entry programs that allow people being released from incarceration to return to family, community and work. She wants those who have successfully completed re-entry programs to help prevent incarceration by reaching out to juveniles.</p>
